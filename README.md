# What is this tool?

This tool aims to help people who want to more easily import all characters along with
levels, weapons and weapon levels from Genshin Impact for use in websites like
[Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/). It does so by converting the
already available info from Hoyolab's "[Battle Chronicles](https://act.hoyolab.com/app/community-game-records-sea/index.html)"
page into a format known as [.good](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/doc),
which is, in essence, just `.json`.
